---

## ✅ Phase 2: Codebase Analysis & Feature Verification

**Status:** COMPLETED

### Deliverables
- ✅ Implementation gaps document created (`implementation-gaps.md`)
- ✅ 27 issues identified and categorized by severity
- ✅ **5 critical issues fixed**

### Critical Issues Fixed

#### 1. User Data Export (GDPR Compliance) ✅
**File:** `apps/web/src/app/api/user/export/route.ts`

**What was broken:**
- Returned only placeholder/minimal data
- Missing monitors, runs, incidents, memberships, alert channels, rules

**What was fixed:**
- Implemented complete data export with proper Prisma queries
- Fetches all user-related data from across organizations
- Properly excludes sensitive credentials
- Limits runs to 1000 most recent to prevent huge exports
- Returns properly structured JSON with metadata

#### 2. Account Deletion (GDPR Right to Erasure) ✅
**File:** `apps/web/src/app/api/user/export/route.ts`

**What was broken:**
- Accepted confirmation but didn't delete anything
- No safeguards for sole organization owners
- No cleanup of related data

**What was fixed:**
- Verifies user is not sole owner of any organization
- Prevents deletion with helpful error message if sole owner
- Deletes memberships, accounts, verification tokens
- Cascades deletion to user record
- Added note about S3 cleanup requirement

#### 3. API Key Management - Generation & Storage ✅
**File:** `apps/web/src/app/api/api-keys/route.ts`

**What was broken:**
- Returned hardcoded placeholder data
- Keys not stored in database
- No hashing of keys

**What was fixed:**
- Fetches real API keys from database
- Generates secure keys with `pk_` prefix + 96 hex characters
- Hashes keys using SHA-256 before storage
- Enforces rate limit (max 20 keys per org)
- Shows full key only once at creation
- Masks keys in list view (shows first 4 chars)

#### 4. API Key Revocation ✅
**File:** `apps/web/src/app/api/api-keys/[id]/route.ts`

**What was broken:**
- Didn't actually revoke keys
- No permission checking

**What was fixed:**
- Verifies API key belongs to user's organization
- Checks user has OWNER/ADMIN role
- Actually deletes the key from database
- Returns appropriate error codes (404, 403)

#### 5. Team Invitations ✅
**File:** `apps/web/src/app/api/team/invite/route.ts`

**What was broken:**
- No email sending
- No invitation token generation
- Completely non-functional

**What was fixed:**
- Generates signed invitation tokens (JWT-style)
- Creates invitation URL with 7-day expiration
- Sends invitation email via Resend with HTML formatting
- Checks for existing members
- Validates email and role
- Only OWNER/ADMIN can invite

**Implementation Approach:**
- Used token-based invitations (no database model needed)
- Tokens contain: email, role, orgId, orgName, invitedBy, expiresAt
- Signed with HMAC-SHA256 using JWT_SECRET
- Note: To track pending invitations, an Invitation model should be added to schema

## ✅ Phase 3: Unit Testing (Started)

**Status:** IN PROGRESS

### Tests Created

#### 1. User Export API Tests ✅
**File:** `apps/web/src/__tests__/api/user-export.test.ts`

**Coverage:**
- GET /api/user/export (Data Export)
  - ✅ Returns 401 when not authenticated
  - ✅ Exports complete user data when authenticated
  - ✅ Includes all related data (accounts, memberships, monitors, runs, etc.)
  
- DELETE /api/user/export (Account Deletion)
  - ✅ Returns 401 when not authenticated
  - ✅ Returns 400 when confirmation missing
  - ✅ Prevents deletion if user is sole owner
  - ✅ Successfully deletes account with proper cleanup

#### 2. API Keys Tests ✅
**File:** `apps/web/src/__tests__/api/api-keys.test.ts`

**Coverage:**
- GET /api/api-keys (List Keys)
  - ✅ Returns 401 when not authenticated
  - ✅ Lists API keys with masked tokens
  
- POST /api/api-keys (Create Key)
  - ✅ Returns 401 when not authenticated
  - ✅ Returns 404 when user not owner/admin
  - ✅ Returns 429 when limit reached (20 keys)
  - ✅ Creates key with proper hashing
  - ✅ Returns full key only once
  
- DELETE /api/api-keys/[id] (Revoke Key)
  - ✅ Returns 401 when not authenticated
  - ✅ Returns 404 when key not found
  - ✅ Returns 403 when lacking permission
  - ✅ Successfully revokes key

## Issues Remaining

### High Priority (Not Yet Fixed)
1. **Maintenance Windows** - Completely unimplemented
2. **Monitor Updates** - Limited functionality (only updates name)
3. **Monitor Deletion** - Missing S3 cleanup and confirmation
4. **Console.log Statements** - 114 instances in production code
5. **Stripe Placeholder** - Fallback to test key if env var missing

### Medium Priority
6. Missing database indexes
7. Inconsistent error handling
8. Missing input validation on some routes
9. No request timeout handling
10. Commented-out code

### Testing Gaps (In Progress)
11. **Web app**: Need 50+ more unit tests for API routes
12. **Worker**: 0% coverage - needs all tests
13. **CLI**: 0% coverage - needs all tests
14. **Components**: Only 13/50+ components tested
15. **Integration tests**: Need complete user flow tests
16. **E2E tests**: 16 tests exist, need 14+ more

4. Create utility tests for all `src/lib/` functions

### Phase 3b-c (Worker & CLI)
5. Create all worker tests (6 job processors)
6. Create all CLI tests (5 commands)

### Phase 4-10
7. Integration tests for complete flows
8. Expand E2E tests (14+ more tests needed)
9. Performance & accessibility audits
10. Security audit completion
11. Code quality enforcement (remove console.logs)
12. Browser compatibility testing
13. Regression suite & CI/CD setup
14. Final documentation
