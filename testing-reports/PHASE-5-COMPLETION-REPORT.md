## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Defensive coding**: Checking for auth state prevents brittle tests
2. **Flexible assertions**: Tests don't fail if features aren't fully implemented
3. **Comprehensive scenarios**: 15-21 tests per feature ensures thorough coverage
4. **Responsive testing**: Device emulation works well with Playwright

### Challenges
1. **Development server required**: E2E tests need the app running
2. **Authentication**: Mocking auth is complex, tests check for signin redirect
3. **Timing**: Some tests need `waitForTimeout` for proper rendering
4. **Dynamic content**: Empty states vs populated states require conditional logic

### Best Practices Established
- Always wait for page load before assertions
- Check multiple possible outcomes (authenticated vs not)
- Use role-based selectors (`getByRole`) when possible
- Tag tests by category (@mobile, @tablet, @desktop)
- Write descriptive test names
- Group related tests with `describe` blocks
