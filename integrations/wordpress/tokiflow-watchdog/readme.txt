**Why Monitor WP-Cron?**

WordPress wp-cron is fragile. It only runs when someone visits your site. If you have low traffic, your cron jobs (backups, scheduled posts, updates) may never run!

**What is Tokiflow?**

Tokiflow is a modern cron monitoring service. It tracks your scheduled jobs and alerts you when they fail, run late, or behave unusually.

**Pricing:**

* Free plan: 5 monitors (perfect for WordPress sites)
* Pro plan: 100 monitors, advanced features ($19/month)
* Self-hosted option available

6. Paste token into the plugin settings
