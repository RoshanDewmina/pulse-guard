## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### 1. Worker DNS Resolution (Upstash Redis)
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Connection Issues

The worker is running but experiencing DNS resolution errors when trying to connect to Upstash Redis:
```
Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND destined-halibut-23907.upstash.io
```

**Possible Causes:**
- Temporary Fly.io DNS resolution issue
- Upstash Redis endpoint may need IPv6 configuration
- Network policy restrictions

**Solutions to Try:**
1. Check if Upstash Redis is accessible from Fly.io:
   ```bash
   flyctl ssh console --app saturn-worker
   # Then: curl -I https://destined-halibut-23907.upstash.io
   ```

2. Verify Fly.io IPv6 DNS settings:
   ```bash
   flyctl ips list --app saturn-worker
   ```

3. Alternative: Use Upstash REST API instead of direct Redis connection

### 2. Worker Health Check Not Responding
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Port 8080 not listening

The worker deployment shows:
```
WARNING The app is not listening on the expected address and will not be reachable by fly-proxy.
You can fix this by configuring your app to listen on the following addresses:
  - 0.0.0.0:8080
```

**Current Issue:**
The health check server in `apps/worker/src/health.ts` may not be starting properly due to the Redis connection issue.

**Solution:**
The health check will start working once the Redis connection issue is resolved.

### 3. Subdomain DNS Propagation
**Status:** üîÑ In Progress (5-30 minutes)

The following subdomains are configured but DNS is still propagating:
- app.saturnmonitor.com
- api.saturnmonitor.com
- status.saturnmonitor.com
- docs.saturnmonitor.com

**Check Propagation:**
```bash
nslookup app.saturnmonitor.com
```

## üîß Configuration Applied

### Fixes Implemented

1. **Pino-Pretty Logging Issue** ‚úÖ
   - Removed pino-pretty transport from production build
   - Simplified logger to use JSON logging
   - Added `--external pino-pretty` to build command

2. **TypeScript Errors** ‚úÖ
   - Fixed Prisma relation capitalization issues
   - Added missing `id` and `updatedAt` fields to create operations
   - Fixed NextAuth.js typing issues

3. **Monorepo Build** ‚úÖ
   - Configured Vercel to use Bun
   - Set up correct build paths for monorepo
   - Generated Prisma client in build process

4. **Docker Build** ‚úÖ
   - Created Dockerfile for worker with Bun support
   - Configured multi-stage build for optimization
   - Fixed Prisma client paths in Docker

---

## üìã Next Steps

### Immediate (Required)

1. **Fix Worker Redis Connection**
   - Investigate Fly.io DNS settings
   - Consider using Upstash REST API
   - Test connection from Fly.io machine

2. **Add Worker Subdomain DNS**
   ```bash
   # Via Vercel Dashboard:
   # Go to: https://vercel.com/roshandewminas-projects/domains/saturnmonitor.com/dns
   # Add Record:
   #   Type: CNAME
   #   Name: worker
   #   Value: saturn-worker.fly.dev
   ```

3. **Update Google OAuth Redirect URIs**
   - Add: `https://saturnmonitor.com/api/auth/callback/google`
   - Add: `https://app.saturnmonitor.com/api/auth/callback/google` (if using app subdomain)

### Optional (Recommended)

4. **Update NEXTAUTH_URL**
   If using app subdomain for dashboard:
   ```
   NEXTAUTH_URL=https://app.saturnmonitor.com
   ```

5. **Set Up Monitoring**
   - Configure Vercel Analytics
   - Set up Fly.io metrics dashboard
   - Configure alerting for worker issues

6. **Test All Features**
   - User registration/login
   - Monitor creation
   - Incident creation
   - Email notifications
   - Slack notifications
   - Status pages

7. **Performance Optimization**
   - Enable Vercel Edge Functions
   - Configure CDN caching
   - Optimize database queries

## üöÄ Ready to Launch!

Your Saturn Monitor application is successfully deployed! The main application is live at **https://saturnmonitor.com**.
