# Redis Hosting Options - Cost Comparison

Your worker hit the **500,000 requests/month** free tier limit. Here are all your options, from **FREE** to premium:

## üÜì Option 1: Self-Host Redis on Fly.io (FREE or ~$2/month)

**BEST OPTION** - Use Fly.io's free tier to host your own Redis container!

### Pros
- ‚úÖ **FREE** or ~$1.94/month (uses existing Fly.io allowance)
- ‚úÖ No request limits
- ‚úÖ Same datacenter as your worker (faster)
- ‚úÖ Full control over Redis configuration
- ‚úÖ Can scale storage as needed

### Cons
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires setup (~15 minutes)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è You manage backups (but easy to automate)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No managed UI dashboard

### Cost Breakdown
Fly.io free tier includes:
- 3 shared-cpu-1x VMs (256MB RAM each)
- 3GB persistent storage
- 160GB outbound data

**Redis container would use:**
- 1 VM (256MB RAM) = **FREE** (within allowance)
- 1GB persistent storage = **FREE** (within allowance)
- Minimal bandwidth (internal communication)

**Total: $0-2/month** (only if you exceed free tier limits)

### Setup Script
I can create a one-command setup script for you:
```bash
./setup-redis-flyio.sh
```

This will:
1. Create a Fly.io Redis app
2. Configure persistence
3. Update your worker environment variables
4. Restart the worker

**If you hit 1M requests:** $0.20 √ó 5 = **$1.00/month**  
**If you hit 2M requests:** $0.20 √ó 15 = **$3.00/month**

### Pros
- ‚úÖ No setup required (just upgrade)

## üéØ Recommended Solution: Self-Host on Fly.io

**Why this is best for you:**

1. **Essentially FREE** - Uses your existing Fly.io free tier
2. **No limits** - Host as much as you need
3. **Better performance** - Redis in same datacenter as worker
4. **Simple** - One-command setup

### What You're Currently Using Redis For

Based on your code, Redis is used for:
- **BullMQ job queues** (evaluator, alerts, email, Slack, Discord, webhooks)
- **Scheduled jobs** (monitor evaluation every 60 seconds)
- **Job state management**

**Estimated data size:** < 50MB (plenty of room in free tier)

## üöÄ Next Steps - I'll Set It Up For You

If you want Option 1 (self-hosted on Fly.io), I can:

1. ‚úÖ Create the Redis Fly.io app
2. ‚úÖ Configure persistent storage
3. ‚úÖ Set up automated backups
4. ‚úÖ Update worker environment variables
5. ‚úÖ Test the connection
6. ‚úÖ Restart your worker

**Total time: ~5 minutes**

Or if you prefer Option 3 (Redis Cloud Free):
- You create the account at https://redis.io/try-free/
- I'll help you migrate the connection strings

## üí° Why You Hit the Limit

Your worker runs evaluations **every 60 seconds** and uses Redis for job queuing. Based on the logs:

- **Evaluations:** 60 seconds = 43,200 per month
- **Each evaluation** queries monitors, creates jobs, updates state
- **Estimated:** ~12 Redis operations per evaluation
- **Total:** 43,200 √ó 12 = **518,400 operations**

That's why you hit the 500K limit! This is normal for a monitoring system.

---

## üîß Optimization Tips (Optional)

If you want to reduce Redis usage:

1. **Increase evaluation interval** (60s ‚Üí 120s = 50% reduction)
2. **Batch operations** (process multiple monitors per transaction)
3. **Use in-memory caching** (reduce repeated queries)
4. **Clean up old jobs** (BullMQ keeps completed jobs by default)

But honestly, **just self-host it**. It's free and solves the problem forever.
