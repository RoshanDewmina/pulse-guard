# Two-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Protect your Saturn account with an extra layer of security using Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP).

## Overview

Two-factor authentication (2FA/MFA) adds an additional security layer to your account by requiring both your password and a time-based code from your authenticator app.

**Features:**
- TOTP-based authentication (compatible with Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password, etc.)
- 10 single-use backup codes for emergency access
- Secure encryption of secrets at rest (AES-256-GCM)
- Session-based verification (verify once per session)

## Enabling MFA

### Step 1: Navigate to Security Settings

1. Click your profile icon in the top-right corner
2. Select **Settings** → **Security**
3. Click **Enable Two-Factor Authentication**

### Step 2: Scan QR Code

1. Open your authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password, etc.)
2. Scan the QR code displayed on screen
3. Alternatively, manually enter the secret key shown below the QR code

### Step 3: Verify Setup

1. Enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app
2. Click **Verify and Enable**
3. Download and securely store your backup codes

:::warning Important
**Save your backup codes immediately!** They will only be shown once. Store them in a secure location like a password manager or encrypted file.
:::

## Using Backup Codes

Backup codes are single-use emergency access codes that let you sign in if you lose access to your authenticator app.

### When to Use Backup Codes

- Lost or broken phone
- Uninstalled authenticator app
- New device without authenticator access

### How to Use

1. On the MFA challenge page, click **Use backup code instead**
2. Enter one of your 10 backup codes
3. The code will be consumed and cannot be reused

### Regenerating Backup Codes

If you've used several backup codes or want fresh ones:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Security**
2. Click **Regenerate Backup Codes**
3. Verify with your authenticator app
4. Download the new codes (old codes will be invalid ated)

## Disabling MFA

:::caution Security Warning
Disabling MFA makes your account less secure. Only do this if absolutely necessary.
:::

To disable MFA:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Security**
2. Click **Disable MFA**
3. Verify with either:
   - Your authenticator app code
   - A backup code
4. Confirm the action

## Best Practices

### Do's ✅

- **Store backup codes securely** in a password manager or encrypted file
- **Use a reputable authenticator app** like Google Authenticator, Authy, or 1Password
- **Set up MFA on a device you regularly have access to**
- **Test your backup codes** periodically to ensure they work

### Don'ts ❌

- **Don't share your backup codes** with anyone
- **Don't store backup codes in plain text** on your computer
- **Don't screenshot the QR code** and leave it unencrypted
- **Don't rely solely on one device** – consider using cloud-synced authenticators like Authy

## Troubleshooting

### Code Not Working

If your authenticator code isn't being accepted:

1. **Check time sync** – TOTP codes are time-sensitive. Ensure your device's clock is accurate
2. **Wait for new code** – Each code is valid for 30 seconds. Try the next code
3. **Try a backup code** – Use one of your emergency backup codes

### Lost Access

If you've lost access to both your authenticator and backup codes:

1. Contact support at [support@saturnmonitor.com](mailto:support@saturnmonitor.com)
2. Provide proof of account ownership
3. Our team will assist with account recovery (may take 24-48 hours)

### Authenticator App Recommendations

- **Google Authenticator** – Simple, reliable (iOS/Android)
- **Authy** – Cloud backup, multi-device (iOS/Android/Desktop)
- **1Password** – Integrated with password manager
- **Microsoft Authenticator** – Enterprise-friendly

## Security Details

### Encryption

- TOTP secrets are encrypted using **AES-256-GCM** before storage
- Backup codes are **bcrypt-hashed** before encryption
- Encryption keys are managed securely via environment variables
- No plaintext secrets are ever stored

### Session Management

- MFA verification is required once per session
- Sessions expire based on your NextAuth configuration
- Signing out clears the MFA verification status

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use the same authenticator for multiple accounts?**  
A: Yes! Most authenticator apps support multiple accounts. Each will have its own entry.

**Q: What happens if I lose my phone?**  
A: Use a backup code to sign in, then set up MFA on your new device.

**Q: How long are backup codes valid?**  
A: Backup codes never expire but are single-use. Regenerate them if you've used several.

**Q: Can I use SMS for 2FA?**  
A: SMS 2FA is not currently supported due to security concerns. TOTP apps are more secure.

**Q: Does MFA affect API access?**  
A: No, API keys work independently of MFA. However, we recommend using MFA to protect the account that creates API keys.
