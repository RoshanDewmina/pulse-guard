# Monitor Tags

Organize your monitors with tags to easily filter, group, and manage them across your organization.

## Overview

Tags are labels you can attach to monitors to categorize and organize them. They're especially useful when you have many monitors across different environments, services, or teams.

**Benefits:**
- Quickly filter monitors by tag on the dashboard
- Group related monitors together
- Identify monitors by environment, service, team, or any custom category
- Improve monitoring organization as your infrastructure grows

## Creating Tags

### Via Monitor Form

When creating or editing a monitor:

1. Scroll to the **Tags** section
2. Start typing a tag name
3. Select an existing tag or press Enter to create a new one
4. Add multiple tags as needed
5. Save the monitor

### Via Tags Management

1. Go to **Settings** → **Tags** (coming soon)
2. Click **Create Tag**
3. Enter a tag name
4. Click **Save**

## Tag Naming Conventions

### Recommended Patterns

**Environment Tags:**
```
production
staging  
development
test
```

**Service Tags:**
```
api
database
frontend
worker
cache
```

**Team Tags:**
```
team-platform
team-devops
team-backend
```

**Priority Tags:**
```
critical
high-priority
low-priority
```

**Custom Categories:**
```
customer-facing
internal
scheduled
on-demand
```

### Best Practices

- Use **lowercase** for consistency
- Use **hyphens** instead of spaces (e.g., `high-priority` not `high priority`)
- Keep names **short and descriptive** (under 20 characters)
- Use a **consistent naming scheme** across your org
- Avoid **redundant prefixes** (e.g., use `production` not `env-production`)

## Using Tags

### Filtering Monitors

On the monitors dashboard:

1. Click the **Filter** icon or dropdown
2. Select one or more tags
3. The monitor list updates to show only matching monitors
4. Tags are combined with AND logic (monitor must have all selected tags)

### URL Filtering

Tags are reflected in the URL for easy bookmarking:
```
/app/monitors?tags=production,api
```

Share filtered views with your team by copying the URL.

### Multi-Tag Filtering

You can filter by multiple tags:
- `production + api` → Shows only monitors tagged with BOTH
- Clear filters to see all monitors again

## Managing Tags

### Renaming Tags

(Coming soon)

1. Go to **Settings** → **Tags**
2. Click the tag you want to rename
3. Enter the new name
4. All monitors using this tag will be updated automatically

### Deleting Tags

To delete a tag:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Tags**
2. Click the **Delete** icon next to the tag
3. Confirm the deletion
4. The tag will be removed from all monitors

:::tip
Deleting a tag doesn't delete the monitors – it just removes the tag from them.

### Bulk Tag Operations

(Coming soon)

- Add tags to multiple monitors at once
- Remove tags from multiple monitors
- Replace tags across monitors

## Examples

### Example 1: Environment-Based Organization

```
Production API Monitor       → production, api, critical
Production Database Monitor  → production, database, critical
Staging API Monitor          → staging, api
Development Worker Monitor   → development, worker
```

**Filter by `production`** → See all production monitors  
**Filter by `production + api`** → See only production API monitors

### Example 2: Team-Based Organization

```
Auth Service Monitor         → team-platform, api, critical
User Service Monitor         → team-platform, api, high-priority
Postgres Backup Monitor      → team-devops, database, critical
Redis Monitor                → team-devops, cache
```

**Filter by `team-platform`** → See Platform team's monitors  
**Filter by `critical`** → See all critical monitors across teams

### Example 3: Custom Categories

```
Customer Checkout Monitor    → customer-facing, critical, production
Internal Admin Panel Monitor → internal, production
Scheduled Report Job         → scheduled, low-priority
On-Demand Export Job         → on-demand, worker
```

**Filter by `customer-facing`** → See monitors affecting customers  
**Filter by `scheduled`** → See all scheduled job monitors

## Advanced Use Cases

### Alert Rules with Tags

(Coming soon)

Create alert rules that target monitors by tag:
- All `production` monitors → alert to PagerDuty
- All `staging` monitors → alert to Slack only
- All `critical` monitors → alert to multiple channels

### Status Pages with Tags

(Coming soon)

Build status pages that show monitors filtered by tags:
- Public status page showing only `customer-facing` monitors
- Internal dashboard showing `production + database` monitors

### API Access

Query monitors by tag via API:
```bash
curl 'https://api.saturn.sh/v1/monitors?tags=production,api' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Limits

- **Tags per monitor**: 10 (recommended: 3-5)
- **Tag name length**: 50 characters
- **Total tags per org**: 100
- **Tag characters**: a-z, 0-9, hyphens, underscores

## Migration from Legacy Tags

If you're using the old string-array tags:

1. Your existing tags will be automatically migrated
2. Duplicates will be consolidated
3. All tag names will be normalized to lowercase
4. Spaces will be converted to hyphens

**No action needed** – the migration happens automatically when you upgrade.

## FAQ

**Q: Are tags case-sensitive?**  
A: No, tags are normalized to lowercase. `Production` and `production` are the same.

**Q: Can I use spaces in tag names?**  
A: Spaces are automatically converted to hyphens. We recommend using hyphens from the start.

**Q: How many tags should I use per monitor?**  
A: We recommend 3-5 tags per monitor. More than that becomes hard to manage.

**Q: Can I share tags across organizations?**  
A: No, tags are scoped to your organization.

**Q: Do tags affect monitoring or alerting?**  
A: Currently no, but we're adding tag-based alert rules soon.

**Q: Can I color-code tags?**  
A: Not yet, but this is on our roadmap!

## Tips & Tricks

### Start Simple

Begin with just environment tags:
- `production`
- `staging`
- `development`

Add more categories as you grow.

### Use Tag Hierarchies

While tags are flat, you can create pseudo-hierarchies with naming:
```
aws-us-east-1
aws-us-west-2
aws-eu-west-1
```

Filter by `aws` (partial match coming soon) to see all AWS monitors.

### Document Your Tags

Create a team document explaining your tagging strategy:
- What each tag means
- When to use which tags
- Tag naming conventions

### Review Regularly

Periodically review your tags:
- Remove unused tags
- Consolidate similar tags
- Ensure consistency across monitors
