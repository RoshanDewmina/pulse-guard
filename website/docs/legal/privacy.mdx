# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** October 16, 2025

Saturn, Inc. ("Saturn", "we", "us", or "our") provides cron and scheduled job monitoring services with statistical anomaly detection. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information when you use our web application, CLI tools, WordPress plugin, Kubernetes sidecar, APIs, and webhooks (collectively, the "Services").

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Account & Authentication Data

When you create an account or authenticate with Saturn, we collect:

- **Email address**: For account creation, magic link authentication, and service communications
- **Google OAuth profile**: If you sign in with Google, we collect your email, name, and profile picture (basic profile information only)
- **Password hash**: If you use password authentication, we store bcrypt-hashed passwords (we never store plaintext passwords)
- **Organization membership**: Your role (OWNER, ADMIN, or MEMBER) within each organization
- **Session data**: JWT tokens managed by NextAuth v5 for session management

**Technical Implementation**: Authentication is handled via NextAuth v5 with JWT session strategy. OAuth tokens are stored securely and used only for authentication purposes.

### 1.2 Billing & Payment Information

For paid subscriptions, we collect:

- **Stripe Customer ID**: A unique identifier linking your organization to your Stripe billing account
- **Subscription metadata**: Plan type (FREE, PRO, BUSINESS), billing cycle, monitor/user limits
- **Invoices**: Billing history and payment records (handled by Stripe)

**What we DON'T store**: Credit card numbers, CVV codes, or other payment card data. All payment information is securely processed and stored by Stripe, our PCI-compliant payment processor.

### 1.3 Monitoring Data

To provide our core monitoring services, we collect:

- **Monitor definitions**: Monitor names, descriptions, cron schedules/intervals, timezone settings, grace periods
- **Ping data**: Timestamps of start/success/fail/timeout events, request metadata (IP addresses for rate limiting)
- **Runtime metrics**: Job durations (milliseconds), exit codes, state transitions (OK → LATE → MISSED → FAILING)
- **Anomaly statistics**: Calculated using Welford's online algorithm
  - Running count of executions
  - Mean duration
  - Standard deviation (stddev)
  - Z-scores for anomaly detection (>3σ triggers incidents)
  - Min/max durations, percentiles (P50/P95/P99)
- **Incident records**: Incident type (MISSED, LATE, FAIL, ANOMALY), status (OPEN, ACKED, RESOLVED), timestamps, acknowledgment notes, resolution details, MTTR (Mean Time To Resolution) calculations
- **Health scores**: 0-100 scores with letter grades (A-F) based on reliability metrics
- **Uptime tracking**: Success rate, MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures), historical trends

**Data Minimization**: We use Welford's algorithm specifically to calculate statistics incrementally without storing every historical data point, minimizing storage footprint to ~40 bytes per monitor.

### 1.4 Output Capture (Optional)

If you enable output capture for a monitor:

- **Job output**: stdout/stderr from your jobs, up to 10KB by default (100KB max for Enterprise plans)
- **Storage location**: Outputs are stored in MinIO (S3-compatible object storage) with key pattern `outputs/{monitorId}/{timestamp}.txt`
- **Automatic redaction**: We apply security patterns to redact:
  - Passwords (e.g., `password=secret` → `password=***REDACTED***`)
  - API keys (e.g., `api_key: abc123` → `api_key: ***REDACTED***`)
  - Bearer tokens (JWT patterns)
  - AWS credentials (`AKIA*`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`)
  - Private keys (`-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----`)
  - Credit card numbers (last 4 digits preserved)
  - Database connection strings with credentials
- **Access control**: Output is scoped to your organization (org-level row-level security)

**IMPORTANT**: While we make best efforts to redact sensitive data, redaction is pattern-based and may not catch all sensitive information. You are responsible for reviewing what data your jobs output. Do not include PHI (Protected Health Information) or highly sensitive data in outputs unless required for debugging.

### 1.5 Integration Data

When you connect third-party integrations:

**Slack**:
- OAuth access tokens (encrypted at rest)
- Workspace ID and name
- Selected channel IDs and names
- OAuth scopes: `chat:write`, `commands`, `channels:read`, `users:read`

**Discord**:
- Webhook URLs (encrypted at rest)
- Server name and channel name

**Generic Webhooks**:
- Webhook endpoint URLs
- HMAC SHA-256 signing secrets (for signature verification)
- Retry configuration

**WordPress Plugin**:
- Site URL
- Plugin version
- wp-cron event names being monitored

**Kubernetes Sidecar**:
- CronJob name and namespace
- Pod name and container name
- Kubernetes cluster identification (from environment variables)
- **Note**: We do NOT collect source code, container images, or cluster credentials

### 1.6 Product Telemetry & Diagnostics

To improve service reliability and performance:

- **Error tracking**: Error messages, stack traces, and diagnostic data sent to Sentry
- **Structured logs**: Application logs stored via Winston logger (IP addresses, timestamps, request paths, user IDs)
- **Audit logs**: Administrative actions (user invitations, role changes, monitor deletions, subscription changes)

### 1.7 Cookies & Local Storage

- **Session cookies**: `next-auth.session-token` (JWT session identifier, httpOnly, secure, SameSite=Lax)
- **CSRF tokens**: `__Host-next-auth.csrf-token` (protection against cross-site request forgery)
- **Analytics**: We use privacy-first analytics with minimal data collection

See our [Cookie Policy](/legal/cookies) for full details.

## 2. How We Use Your Data
