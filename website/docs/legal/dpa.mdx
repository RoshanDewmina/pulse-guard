## 9. International Data Transfers

### 9.1 Data Residency

Personal Data may be stored and processed in the following regions:

- **Primary region**: United States of America
- **Optional regions**: Available for Enterprise customers upon request

### 9.2 EEA/UK Transfers

For Personal Data originating from the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, or Switzerland, Saturn relies on:

**Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)**: The EU Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses for international data transfers (Module 2: Controller-to-Processor), as adopted by Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914, are hereby incorporated by reference and form **Annex C** to this DPA.

**Supplementary Measures**: Saturn implements additional safeguards:

- Access controls limiting personnel who can access EEA data;
- Contractual prohibitions on unauthorized disclosure;
- Commitment to challenge government requests for EEA data where lawful to do so.

For transfers from the UK, the **UK International Data Transfer Addendum** to the SCCs (version B1.0) applies and is incorporated as **Annex D**.

### 9.4 Swiss Addendum

For transfers from Switzerland, the SCCs are modified to replace references to "GDPR" with the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP), and "Supervisory Authority" with the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC).

### 9.5 Adequacy Decisions

If the European Commission adopts an adequacy decision for a country where Saturn processes data, transfers to that country will rely on such adequacy decision instead of SCCs.

Retained data remains subject to confidentiality obligations and this DPA until deletion.

### 10.3 Deletion Certification

Upon request, Saturn will provide written certification that Personal Data has been deleted, including:

- Date of deletion;
- Categories of data deleted;
- Systems from which data was deleted (production database, object storage, backups).

---

In the event of a conflict:

1. This DPA prevails over the Terms with respect to data protection;

## Annex A: Details of Processing

### Subject Matter

Processing of Personal Data in connection with Saturn's cron and scheduled job monitoring Services, including anomaly detection, alerting, and analytics.

### Duration

For the term of the Services agreement, plus 30 days wind-down period.

### Nature and Purpose

- Monitor cron job and scheduled task execution;
- Detect anomalies using statistical analysis (Welford algorithm, z-score);
- Send alerts via email, Slack, Discord, webhooks;
- Generate analytics (health scores, MTBF, MTTR, uptime);
- Store optional job output for debugging (if Customer enables output capture).

### Categories of Data Subjects

- **Employees/Contractors**: Customer's DevOps engineers, SREs, system administrators who use the Services;
- **End Users** (indirect): If Customer's monitored jobs process end-user data, output capture may include such data (Customer's responsibility to control).

### Types of Personal Data

- **Account data**: Email addresses, names, profile pictures (OAuth);
- **Usage data**: IP addresses (for rate limiting), user agent strings, login timestamps;
- **Monitoring metadata**: Monitor names (may include project/customer identifiers), cron schedules, timestamps, durations;
- **Optional output capture**: Job stdout/stderr (may include any data Customer's jobs output, including potentially PII, depending on Customer's job logic);
- **Integration data**: Slack workspace IDs, Discord server names, webhook URLs;
- **Audit logs**: Administrative actions (user invitations, role changes).

### Special Categories of Data

Saturn does **NOT process special categories of data (GDPR Article 9)** such as health data, biometric data, genetic data, or data revealing racial/ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership, sex life, or sexual orientation — **UNLESS** Customer's jobs output such data and Customer enables output capture.

**Customer Responsibility**: Customer must not enable output capture for jobs that output special categories of data without implementing additional safeguards (encryption, pseudonymization) and obtaining explicit Data Subject consent.
