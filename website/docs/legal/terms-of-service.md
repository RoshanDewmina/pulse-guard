# Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** October 16, 2025

**Effective Date:** October 16, 2025

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of Saturn's cron and scheduled job monitoring platform, including our web application, CLI tools, WordPress plugin, Kubernetes sidecar, APIs, and webhooks (the "Services"). By using the Services, you agree to these Terms.

**Agreement Parties**: These Terms constitute a binding contract between you (individual or entity) and Saturn, Inc. ("Saturn", "we", "us", or "our").

<!-- TODO: Update company legal name and governing law once finalized -->

## 1. Acceptance & Changes

### 1.1 Acceptance

By creating an account, accessing the Services, or using our APIs, you agree to:

- These Terms of Service
- Our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy)
- Our [Security practices](/legal/security)
- Any additional terms for specific features (e.g., Enterprise SLA)

If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization to these Terms.

### 1.2 Eligibility

You must be at least 16 years old and capable of forming a binding contract under applicable law. If using on behalf of an organization, that entity must be validly formed and in good standing.

### 1.3 Changes to Terms

We may modify these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of material changes via:

- Email to your account address
- Prominent notice in the application
- Update to the "Last Updated" date above

Continued use after changes take effect constitutes acceptance. If you disagree with changes, stop using the Services and terminate your account.

## 2. Accounts & Organizations

### 2.1 Account Creation

To use the Services, you must create an account by providing:

- Valid email address
- Secure password (if not using OAuth)
- Organization name (automatically created on signup)

You are responsible for:

- Maintaining confidentiality of credentials
- All activity under your account
- Notifying us immediately of unauthorized access (security@saturn.io)

### 2.2 Organizations & Multi-Tenancy

Saturn uses an organization-based model:

- **Organization**: A workspace containing monitors, team members, and billing
- **Primary organization**: Created automatically on signup
- **Multiple organizations**: You may create or join multiple organizations
- **Organization isolation**: Data is strictly segregated between organizations (row-level security)

### 2.3 Roles & Permissions

Each organization has role-based access control (RBAC):

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **OWNER** | Full access: manage monitors, incidents, team, billing, delete organization |
| **ADMIN** | Manage monitors, incidents, alerts, team; cannot access billing or delete organization |
| **MEMBER** | Create/edit own monitors, view team monitors, acknowledge/resolve incidents; read-only for settings |

Organization Owners are responsible for managing team access and ensuring team members comply with these Terms.

## 3. License & Acceptable Use

### 3.1 License Grant

Subject to these Terms, Saturn grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to:

- Access and use the Services via our web application, CLI, and APIs
- Install our WordPress plugin and Kubernetes sidecar on systems you control
- Integrate the Services with your applications via webhooks and APIs

### 3.2 Restrictions

You may NOT:

- Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Services
- Modify, adapt, or create derivative works
- Remove or obscure proprietary notices
- Use the Services to violate any law or third-party rights
- Bypass rate limits or security measures
- Share accounts or API tokens with unauthorized parties
- Use the Services to monitor third-party systems without authorization
- Resell, sublicense, or transfer the Services without written permission

### 3.3 Rate Limits

To ensure fair usage and system stability:

- **Ping API**: 120 requests per minute per monitor token
- **General API**: 60 requests per minute per API key
- **Webhook retries**: Exponential backoff with maximum 3 retry attempts

Exceeding rate limits results in HTTP 429 responses. Persistent abuse may result in account suspension.

### 3.4 Fair Use

The Services are intended for monitoring scheduled jobs and cron tasks. Prohibited uses include:

- High-frequency polling (use intervals â‰¥30 seconds unless legitimately required)
- Stress testing or benchmarking without written permission
- Scraping or bulk downloading of data via automated means
- Monitoring unrelated systems solely to abuse free tier limits

## 4. Customer Data & Output Capture

### 4.1 Your Data Ownership

You retain all ownership rights to data you submit to the Services, including:

- Monitor configurations (names, schedules, metadata)
- Ping timestamps and runtime durations
- Job output (if you enable output capture)

We claim no intellectual property rights over your Customer Data.

### 4.2 License to Process

You grant Saturn a worldwide, non-exclusive license to:

- Store, process, and transmit your Customer Data to provide the Services
- Perform statistical analysis (anomaly detection, health scores, MTBF/MTTR)
- Generate aggregated, anonymized analytics for product improvement

This license terminates when you delete your data or close your account.

### 4.3 Output Capture Responsibility

If you enable **output capture** (optional):

- You are responsible for what data your jobs output
- Our automatic redaction is **best-effort** and may not catch all sensitive data
- Do NOT include PHI, PII, or highly sensitive data unless essential for debugging
- Review outputs before enabling capture for production jobs
- Configure appropriate retention periods for your compliance requirements

**Redaction Patterns**: We automatically redact passwords, API keys, bearer tokens, AWS credentials, private keys, and credit card numbers. However, novel patterns or context-specific secrets may not be caught.

### 4.4 Prohibited Data

You may NOT submit to the Services:

- Protected Health Information (PHI) under HIPAA without a signed Business Associate Agreement (BAA)
- Payment Card Industry (PCI) data (credit card details) beyond what our redaction may inadvertently capture
- Illegal, defamatory, or infringing content
- Malware, viruses, or malicious code

## 5. Integrations & Third-Party Services

### 5.1 Slack Integration

When you connect Slack via OAuth:

- You authorize Saturn to post messages to your selected channels
- We request minimal scopes: `chat:write`, `commands`, `channels:read`, `users:read`
- You can revoke access anytime via Slack's App Management
- Slack's own Terms of Service apply to your Slack workspace

### 5.2 Discord & Webhooks

For Discord and generic webhooks:

- **Discord**: You provide webhook URLs; we send JSON embeds to your Discord channels
- **Generic webhooks**: We POST JSON payloads to your HTTPS endpoints
- **HMAC signatures**: Webhooks include `X-Saturn-Signature` header (HMAC SHA-256) for verification
- **Retries**: Failed webhooks are retried up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- **Your responsibility**: Verify signatures, handle retries gracefully, secure your webhook endpoints

### 5.3 Kubernetes & WordPress

- **Kubernetes sidecar**: You deploy our open-source Go sidecar container; it sends pings to our API
- **WordPress plugin**: You install our open-source PHP plugin; it monitors wp-cron execution
- **License**: Both integrations are licensed under their respective open-source licenses (see repositories)
- **Support**: Community support for open-source integrations; priority support for paid plans
