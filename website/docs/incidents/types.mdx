# Incident Types

Saturn creates incidents automatically when jobs deviate from expected behavior. Understanding each type helps you respond appropriately.

## Incident Types

### MISSED

**Trigger**: No ping received within expected schedule + grace period

**Meaning**: Job didn't run at all, or couldn't reach Saturn

**Common Causes**:
- Cron daemon not running
- Job disabled/commented out
- Server down or unreachable
- Network connectivity issues
- DNS resolution failure

**Example**:

```
Incident: MISSED
Monitor: Daily Backup
Expected: 2025-10-14 03:00:00 UTC
Grace Period: 30 minutes
Status: No ping received by 03:30:00 UTC
```

**Response Actions**:
1. Check if the server/service is running
2. Verify cron configuration (`crontab -l`)
3. Check system logs for errors
4. Test network connectivity to Saturn API

---

### LATE

**Trigger**: Ping received after grace period expired

**Meaning**: Job ran but started/finished late

**Common Causes**:
- Server under heavy load
- Resource constraints (CPU/memory)
- Dependency delays (database, API, etc.)
- Grace period too short
- Clock skew between systems

**Example**:

```
Incident: LATE
Monitor: Hourly Sync
Expected: 2025-10-14 10:00:00 UTC
Grace Period: 5 minutes
Actual Ping: 10:07:23 UTC (7 minutes late)
```

**Response Actions**:
1. Review job duration trends in analytics
2. Check server resources during incident time
3. Consider increasing grace period if consistently late
4. Investigate dependencies that might be slow

---

### FAIL

**Trigger**: Explicit fail ping received (exit code ≠ 0)

**Meaning**: Job ran but reported failure

**Common Causes**:
- Application logic error
- External service unavailable
- Invalid input data
- Permission issues
- Disk space full
- Database connection failed

**Example**:

```
Incident: FAIL
Monitor: Database Backup
Exit Code: 1
Duration: 3.2 seconds
Output: ERROR: Connection to database failed after 3 retries
        Host: db.example.com:5432
        Reason: Connection timeout
```

**Response Actions**:
1. Review captured output for error details
2. Check external dependencies (databases, APIs)
3. Verify permissions and credentials
4. Review application logs
5. Test the job manually to reproduce

---

### ANOMALY

**Trigger**: Job succeeded but behaved abnormally

**Meaning**: Statistical analysis detected deviation from baseline

**Common Causes**:
- Performance degradation
- Increased data volume
- Resource contention
- Network latency spike
- Configuration change
- Code regression

**Anomaly Sub-Types**:

#### Duration Anomaly (Z-Score)

```
Incident: ANOMALY (Duration)
Monitor: ETL Pipeline
Duration: 47 minutes (typical: 12 minutes)
Z-Score: 4.2 (threshold: 3.0)
Analysis:
  Mean: 12.3 minutes
  Std Dev: 8.2 minutes
  This run: 3.5 standard deviations above mean
```

#### Duration Anomaly (Median Multiplier)

```
Incident: ANOMALY (Duration)
Monitor: Report Generation
Duration: 89 seconds (median: 15 seconds)
Multiplier: 5.9x (threshold: 5.0x)
Analysis:
  Median: 15 seconds
  This run: 5.9 times the median
```

#### Output Size Drop

```
Incident: ANOMALY (Output Size)
Monitor: Data Export
Output: 234 bytes (median: 45 KB)
Drop: 99.5% (threshold: 50%)
Analysis:
  Median Output: 45,231 bytes
  This run: 234 bytes
  Possible empty export or early termination
```

**Response Actions**:
1. Review analytics for performance trends
2. Compare with recent successful runs
3. Check for infrastructure changes
4. Investigate data volume changes
5. Review recent code deployments
6. Use [Anomaly Tuning](../anomalies/tuning) to adjust sensitivity

## Incident Severity

| Type | Default Severity | Description |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| **MISSED** | High | Job didn't run — immediate action needed |
| **LATE** | Medium | Job ran late — monitor for patterns |
| **FAIL** | High | Job failed — investigate and fix |
| **ANOMALY** | Low-Medium | Job succeeded but unusual — investigate if recurring |

Severity affects:
- Alert priority
- Escalation rules
- Dashboard sorting

## Incident Metadata

Every incident includes:

```json
{
  "id": "inc_abc123",
  "type": "ANOMALY",
  "monitorId": "mon_xyz789",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "status": "OPEN",
  "createdAt": "2025-10-14T10:15:00Z",
  "acknowledgedAt": null,
  "resolvedAt": null,
  "details": {
    "zScore": 3.7,
    "meanMs": 9800,
    "stddevMs": 1100,
    "durationMs": 14050,
    "rule": "zscore>3"
  },
  "runId": "run_def456",
  "alertsSent": ["slack", "email"]
}
```

## Incident Timeline

Each incident maintains an event log:

1. **Created**: Incident detected
2. **Alerts Sent**: Notification channels triggered
3. **Acknowledged**: Team member acknowledged
4. **Notes Added**: Investigation notes
5. **Resolved**: Issue fixed and incident closed

View full timeline in the dashboard.

## Multiple Incidents

Same monitor can have multiple open incidents:

```
Monitor: Nightly Backup
  Incident 1: LATE (Oct 13) - RESOLVED
  Incident 2: ANOMALY (Oct 14) - OPEN
  Incident 3: FAIL (Oct 14) - OPEN
```

Each is tracked independently.

## Deduplication

Saturn prevents alert spam:

- **MISSED**: One alert per grace period expiration
- **LATE**: One alert per late ping
- **FAIL**: One alert per failed run
- **ANOMALY**: One alert per anomalous run

If a monitor is already in incident state, new pings update the existing incident rather than creating duplicates (configurable).
