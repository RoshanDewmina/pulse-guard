# Health Scores

Saturn assigns every monitor a **health score** (0-100) and letter grade (A-F) based on reliability, performance, and incident history.

## Scoring System

### Score Ranges

| Score | Grade | Status | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|--------|----------------|
| 95-100 | A+ | Excellent | Near-perfect reliability |
| 90-94 | A | Very Good | Occasional minor issues |
| 85-89 | B+ | Good | Acceptable performance |
| 80-84 | B | Above Average | Some concerns |
| 75-79 | C+ | Average | Needs attention |
| 70-74 | C | Below Average | Action required |
| 60-69 | D | Poor | Serious issues |
| 0-59 | F | Critical | Failing |

## How Scores are Calculated

Health scores combine multiple factors:

```
Health Score = (
  Uptime Weight × Uptime Score +
  Incident Weight × Incident Score +
  Anomaly Weight × Anomaly Score +
  Consistency Weight × Consistency Score
) / Total Weight
```

### Factor 1: Uptime (40% weight)

```
Uptime Score = (Successful Pings / Total Expected Pings) × 100
```

**Example**:
```
Expected: 30 pings (daily for 30 days)
Successful: 28 pings
Uptime: 28/30 = 93.3%
Uptime Score: 93.3
```

### Factor 2: Incidents (30% weight)

```
Incident Score = 100 - (Incident Penalty × Number of Incidents)
```

**Penalty by Type**:
- MISSED: -5 points per incident
- LATE: -2 points per incident
- FAIL: -5 points per incident
- ANOMALY: -1 point per incident

**Example**:
```
Last 30 days:
- 2 MISSED incidents: -10 points
- 5 LATE incidents: -10 points
- 1 FAIL incident: -5 points
- 3 ANOMALY incidents: -3 points

Incident Score = 100 - 28 = 72
```

### Factor 3: Anomaly Frequency (15% weight)

```
Anomaly Score = 100 - (Anomaly Rate × 100 × 5)
```

**Example**:
```
Anomalies: 4
Total runs: 100
Anomaly Rate: 4%

Anomaly Score = 100 - (0.04 × 100 × 5) = 80
```

### Factor 4: Consistency (15% weight)

```
Consistency Score = max(0, 100 - (CV × 200))

Where CV = Coefficient of Variation = StdDev / Mean
```

**Example**:
```
Mean duration: 12 minutes
Std Dev: 3 minutes
CV = 3/12 = 0.25

Consistency Score = 100 - (0.25 × 200) = 50
```

### Combined Example

```
Monitor: Daily Backup

Uptime Score: 93.3
Incident Score: 72
Anomaly Score: 80
Consistency Score: 50

Health Score = (
  0.40 × 93.3 +
  0.30 × 72 +
  0.15 × 80 +
  0.15 × 50
) = 37.32 + 21.6 + 12 + 7.5 = 78.42

Grade: C+
```

## Time Windows

Health scores are calculated for multiple time windows:

| Window | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| **7 days** | Current health, recent trends |
| **30 days** | Monthly SLA reports |
| **90 days** | Quarterly reviews |
| **All time** | Historical baseline |

View all windows in the dashboard.

## Org-Level Health

Organization health = weighted average of all monitors:

```
Org Health = Σ(Monitor Health × Monitor Weight) / Σ(Monitor Weight)
```

**Monitor Weights**:
- Critical monitors: 3x weight
- Normal monitors: 1x weight
- Low-priority monitors: 0.5x weight

Set weight in monitor settings:

```json
{
  "name": "Production API",
  "priority": "critical"  // 3x weight in org health
}
```

## Health Dashboard

### Org Dashboard Widgets

**Health Distribution**:
```
A: ████████████████ 45%
B: ████████ 25%
C: ████ 15%
D: ██ 10%
F: █ 5%
```

**Top/Bottom Monitors**:
```
Best:
1. Daily Backup (A+, 98)
2. API Health Check (A, 94)
3. Log Rotation (A, 92)

Worst:
1. Legacy ETL (F, 45) ⚠️
2. Weekend Deploy (D, 63)
3. Cache Rebuild (C, 74)
```

**Trend**:
```
7-day trend: ↗ +5 points
30-day trend: → stable
90-day trend: ↗ +12 points
```

## Improving Health Scores

### Scenario 1: Low Uptime Score

**Current**: 75 (C+)  
**Uptime**: 85%

**Actions**:
1. Fix root cause of MISSED incidents
2. Adjust grace periods to reduce LATE incidents
3. Add redundancy/retries to jobs
4. **Impact**: +10-15 points

### Scenario 2: High Incident Count

**Current**: 70 (C)  
**Incidents**: 15 FAIL in 30 days

**Actions**:
1. Review and fix failing jobs
2. Add input validation
3. Improve error handling
4. Monitor dependencies
5. **Impact**: +15-20 points

### Scenario 3: Frequent Anomalies

**Current**: 82 (B)  
**Anomalies**: 12% of runs

**Actions**:
1. Investigate performance degradation
2. Optimize slow queries/operations
3. Tune anomaly thresholds (if false positives)
4. **Impact**: +5-10 points

### Scenario 4: High Variance

**Current**: 78 (C+)  
**CV**: 0.4 (very inconsistent)

**Actions**:
1. Identify and fix variable performance
2. Consistent resource allocation
3. Remove dependencies on shared resources
4. **Impact**: +5-10 points
