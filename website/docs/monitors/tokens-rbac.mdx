# Tokens & RBAC

Control access to your monitors with API tokens and role-based permissions.

## Token Types

### Organization Tokens

**Scope**: All monitors within an organization

**Best for**:
- CI/CD pipelines
- Kubernetes deployments (auto-register monitors)
- WordPress bulk rollouts
- CLI authentication

**Permissions**:
- Create monitors
- Send pings to any monitor
- View all monitors
- Manage incidents

**Example**:

```bash
# Automatically creates monitor if it doesn't exist
saturn run --token YOUR_ORG_TOKEN --name "New Job" -- ./script.sh
```

### Monitor Tokens

**Scope**: Single monitor only

**Best for**:
- Least-privilege access
- Third-party integrations
- Shared access to specific monitors
- Per-environment isolation

**Permissions**:
- Send pings to this monitor only
- View this monitor's data
- Cannot create monitors
- Cannot access other monitors

**Example**:

```bash
# Can only ping this one monitor
curl -X POST https://api.saturn.example.com/api/ping/YOUR_MONITOR_ID/success \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <MONITOR_TOKEN>"
```

### User Tokens

**Scope**: Actions on behalf of a specific user

**Best for**:
- Personal automation scripts
- Custom dashboards
- API exploration

**Permissions**: Based on user's role in organization

## Token Management

### Creating Tokens

**Organization Token**:
1. Go to **Settings → Tokens**
2. Click **Create Organization Token**
3. Name it (e.g., "CI Pipeline")
4. Copy and save securely

**Monitor Token**:
1. Open monitor settings
2. Go to **API Access**
3. Click **Generate Token**
4. Copy and save securely

:::warning Token Security
Tokens are only shown once. Store them in a password manager or secrets vault (GitHub Secrets, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.).
:::

### Rotating Tokens

Rotate tokens regularly (e.g., every 90 days):

1. Create a new token
2. Update all services using the old token
3. Verify pings are working
4. Delete the old token

**Zero-downtime rotation**:

```bash
# Step 1: Generate new token in UI (don't delete old one yet)

# Step 2: Update services one by one
kubectl set env deployment/cronjob SATURN_TOKEN=<NEW_TOKEN>

# Step 3: Monitor dashboard to ensure pings continue

# Step 4: Delete old token
```

### Revoking Tokens

Delete compromised tokens immediately:

1. Go to **Settings → Tokens**
2. Find the token
3. Click **Delete** or **Revoke**

Effects:
- All requests using this token will fail with `401 Unauthorized`
- No data is deleted
- Historical runs/pings remain intact

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### Roles

| Role | Monitors | Incidents | Settings | Billing | Invite Users |
|------|----------|-----------|----------|---------|--------------|
| **Owner** | ✓ Full | ✓ Full | ✓ Full | ✓ Full | ✓ |
| **Admin** | ✓ Full | ✓ Full | ✓ Full | ✗ | ✓ |
| **Member** | ✓ Create/Edit | ✓ Ack/Resolve | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| **Viewer** | ✓ Read-only | ✓ Read-only | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |

### Assigning Roles

1. Go to **Settings → Team**
2. Click **Invite Member**
3. Enter email and select role
4. User receives invitation email

### Changing Roles

1. Go to **Settings → Team**
2. Find user
3. Change role dropdown
4. Changes apply immediately

### Removing Access

1. Go to **Settings → Team**
2. Find user
3. Click **Remove**
4. User loses all access immediately

## Organizations

Organize your monitors across teams, projects, or environments.

### Creating Organizations

1. Click organization dropdown (top-left)
2. Select **Create Organization**
3. Enter name
4. Invite initial team members

### Use Cases

**Multi-tenant SaaS**:
```
- MyCompany (root org)
  - Customer A (sub-org)
  - Customer B (sub-org)
```

**Department-based**:
```
- Engineering Org
  - Backend Team
  - Frontend Team
  - DevOps Team
```

**Environment-based**:
```
- Production
- Staging
- Development
```

### Switching Organizations

Click the organization dropdown (top-left) and select.

Organization-scoped:
- Monitors
- Incidents
- Alert channels
- Tokens
- Team members

NOT organization-scoped:
- User accounts
- Billing (can be at parent org level)

## Token Best Practices

### ✅ Do

1. **Use org tokens for automation**

   ```yaml
   # GitHub Actions
   env:
     SATURN_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SATURN_ORG_TOKEN }}
   ```

2. **Use monitor tokens for restricted access**

   Share with third parties who only need access to specific monitors.

3. **Rotate tokens regularly**

   Set calendar reminders for quarterly rotation.

4. **Store tokens securely**

   Use secrets management:
   - GitHub/GitLab Secrets
   - AWS Secrets Manager
   - HashiCorp Vault
   - 1Password / Bitwarden

5. **Use descriptive names**

   ```
   ✓ "GitHub Actions - Production Deploy"
   ✗ "Token 1"
   ```

### ❌ Don't

1. **Commit tokens to git**

   ```bash
   # Add to .gitignore
   .env
   .saturn/config.json
   ```

2. **Share tokens via chat/email**

   Use a password manager or secrets link that expires.

3. **Use the same token everywhere**

   Create separate tokens per service for easier rotation.

4. **Log tokens**

   ```bash
   # BAD
   echo "Using token: $SATURN_TOKEN"
   
   # GOOD
   echo "Using token: ${SATURN_TOKEN:0:8}..."
   ```

## API Token Scopes

Future feature: fine-grained scopes per token.

Planned scopes:
- `monitors:read` — View monitors
- `monitors:write` — Create/update monitors
- `pings:write` — Send pings
- `incidents:read` — View incidents
- `incidents:write` — Acknowledge/resolve incidents
- `settings:read` — View org settings
- `settings:write` — Modify org settings

Currently, tokens have all-or-nothing scope based on type (org vs monitor).

## SSO & SAML (Enterprise)

Enterprise plans support Single Sign-On:

**Supported providers**:
- Okta
- Azure AD
- Google Workspace
- OneLogin
- Auth0

**Features**:
- Automatic provisioning
- Group-based role assignment
- Centralized access control

Contact sales for SSO setup.

## Audit Logs

Track token usage and access:

1. Go to **Settings → Audit Log**
2. Filter by user, action, or date range

Logged events:
- Token creation/deletion
- Role changes
- Monitor access
- Incident actions
- Settings changes

:::tip Compliance
Export audit logs (CSV/JSON) for compliance requirements (SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.).
:::

## IP Allowlisting (Enterprise)

Restrict API access to specific IP ranges:

```json
{
  "allowedIps": [
    "192.168.1.0/24",
    "10.0.0.0/8",
    "2001:db8::/32"
  ]
}
```

Available on Enterprise plans.
