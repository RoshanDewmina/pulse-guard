# Security Overview

Saturn employs multiple layers of security to protect your data.

## Authentication

### Token Hashing

All tokens hashed with SHA-256 before storage.

### Session Management

- HTTP-only cookies
- Secure flag in production
- SameSite=Lax for CSRF protection

## Authorization

### Row-Level Security (RLS)

Every query filtered by `orgId`:

\`\`\`sql
SELECT * FROM monitors WHERE org_id = current_org_id();
\`\`\`

### RBAC

Role-based access control (Owner, Admin, Member, Viewer).

## Rate Limiting

- **Ping API**: 60 req/min per monitor
- **Auth**: 5 login attempts per 15 min
- **API**: 1000 req/hour per org

## HTTPS Everywhere

All traffic encrypted with TLS 1.3.

## Next Steps

- [Redaction](./redaction) — Sensitive data patterns
- [Tokens & RBAC](../monitors/tokens-rbac) — Access control
