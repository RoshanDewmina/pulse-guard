# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

**What is Saturn?**
Saturn is cron and scheduled job monitoring with anomaly detection, designed for Kubernetes, WordPress, and traditional cron environments.

**How is it different from Cronitor/Healthchecks?**
Saturn adds statistical anomaly detection, catching performance issues before failures. It also has native Kubernetes and WordPress integrations.

**Do I need to change my cron jobs?**
No. Just add a ping URL to your existing jobs, or use our Kubernetes sidecar/WordPress plugin for zero-code monitoring.

## Pricing

**Is there a free tier?**
Yes! 10 monitors, 1 user, 30-day retention, all core features including anomaly detection.

**What happens if I exceed limits?**
You'll receive warnings at 90% usage and have 7 days grace period before limits are enforced.

## Anomaly Detection

**How many runs needed for baseline?**
Minimum 10 successful runs to establish statistical baseline.

**Can I adjust sensitivity?**
Yes, tune Z-Score and median multiplier thresholds per monitor.

**Does it work for variable jobs?**
Yes, use median multiplier instead of Z-Score for high-variance jobs.

## Integrations

**Which alert channels are supported?**
Email, Slack, Discord, and custom webhooks.

**Does Kubernetes require code changes?**
No, our Helm chart deploys a sidecar that monitors automatically.

**Is WordPress wp-cron supported?**
Yes, dedicated plugin for wp-cron monitoring with bulk management.

## Security

**How are tokens stored?**
Hashed with SHA-256, never stored in plaintext.

**Is output data encrypted?**
Yes, encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3).

**Do you redact sensitive data?**
Yes, automatic redaction of passwords, API keys, tokens, etc.

## Support

**How do I get help?**
Email support@saturnmonitor.com or check the docs.

**Is there a status page?**
Yes, status.saturnmonitor.com

**Can I self-host?**
Enterprise plan includes self-hosted option.
