3. **Object Storage** - AWS S3 or Supabase Storage (for output capture)
4. **Google OAuth** - Client ID + Secret (for user authentication)
5. **NEXTAUTH_SECRET** - Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`
6. **Deploy Worker** - `apps/worker` must run for alerts to send

### Should Configure (Week 1)
7. **Domain + SSL** - Purchase domain, point to hosting, enable HTTPS
8. **Slack App** - For Slack integration (high-value feature)
9. **Stripe Account** - For billing (can start free-only)
10. **Error Tracking** - Sentry for monitoring
