# Testing Setup Complete! üéâ

## What Was Created

I've set up a complete E2E testing infrastructure for Saturn using Playwright to prevent issues like the Client Component error from happening again.

### Files Created

1. **`playwright.config.ts`** - Playwright configuration for multi-browser testing
2. **`e2e/auth.spec.ts`** - Authentication flow tests
3. **`e2e/homepage.spec.ts`** - Homepage and navigation tests  
4. **`e2e/monitors.spec.ts`** - Monitor creation flow tests
5. **`e2e/README.md`** - Testing documentation
6. **`.gitignore`** - Updated to exclude test artifacts

### Package.json Updates

Added Playwright to `devDependencies` and test scripts:
- `test:e2e` - Run all tests
- `test:e2e:ui` - Run tests in interactive UI mode
- `test:e2e:headed` - Run tests with visible browser

## Installation Steps

Since this is a Bun workspace, you need to install dependencies from the root:

```bash
# Option 1: Using bun (from project root)
cd /home/roshan/development/personal/Saturn
bun install

# Option 2: Using npm in the web directory (if bun fails)
cd apps/web
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

Then install Playwright browsers:
```bash
cd apps/web
npx playwright install chromium firefox webkit
```

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
1. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev   # from apps/web/
   ```

2. Make sure Docker services are running:
   ```bash
   make docker-up   # from project root
   ```

### Run Tests

```bash
cd apps/web

# Run all tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run with UI (recommended for development)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test e2e/auth.spec.ts
```

## Test Coverage

### ‚úÖ Authentication Tests (`e2e/auth.spec.ts`)

Tests the signin page and fixes we just made:
- ‚úÖ Signin page loads correctly
- ‚úÖ **Google sign in button is clickable** (the bug we fixed!)
- ‚úÖ Email input accepts text
- ‚úÖ Magic link button is functional
- ‚úÖ Page has correct branding
- ‚úÖ Verify request page loads

### ‚úÖ Homepage Tests (`e2e/homepage.spec.ts`)

Tests the homepage and navigation:
- ‚úÖ Homepage loads correctly
- ‚úÖ Navigation buttons work
- ‚úÖ **View Features button works** (the button we fixed!)
- ‚úÖ Features section scrolls into view
- ‚úÖ Features section displays correctly
- ‚úÖ Pricing section displays correctly
- ‚úÖ Quick setup code snippet is visible
- ‚úÖ Footer displays correctly
- ‚úÖ Page is responsive (mobile/tablet)

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Monitor Tests (`e2e/monitors.spec.ts`)

Tests for authenticated flows:
- ‚úÖ Protected routes redirect to signin
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Monitor creation form (requires auth setup)

## Why This Was Needed

The Client Component error we just fixed was **not caught because there were zero tests**:
- No unit tests
- No integration tests  
- No E2E tests
- No CI/CD pipeline

These tests would have caught the issue immediately by:
1. Testing that the signin page loads
2. Clicking the Google button
3. Verifying no runtime errors occur

## Next Steps

1. **Install dependencies** (see Installation Steps above)
2. **Run the tests** to verify everything works
3. **Add to CI/CD**: Configure GitHub Actions to run tests on every PR
4. **Expand coverage**: Add more tests for authenticated flows
5. **Add unit tests**: Consider adding Vitest for component unit tests

## CI/CD Integration

To add these tests to your CI pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: E2E Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: bun install
      - name: Install Playwright
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
      - name: Start services
        run: docker-compose up -d
      - name: Run tests
        run: cd apps/web && npm run test:e2e
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module @playwright/test"
Run `bun install` from project root, then `npx playwright install` from apps/web

### "Connection refused" errors
Make sure the dev server is running on port 3000

### Browser not found
Run `npx playwright install chromium` to download browsers

### Permission errors
Try running with sudo for Playwright system dependencies:
```bash
sudo npx playwright install-deps
```

**Testing is now part of your development workflow!** üöÄ

Every time you add new interactive features, add corresponding E2E tests to catch issues before they reach production.
