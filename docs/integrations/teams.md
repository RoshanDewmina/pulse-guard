## Best Practices

### Channel Organization
- Create separate channels for different teams/environments
- Use descriptive channel names (e.g., "Production Alerts", "Dev Team")
- Consider using private channels for sensitive alerts

### Notification Management
- Set up multiple channels for different severity levels
- Use channel mentions (@channel) for critical incidents
- Configure quiet hours if needed

### Message Customization
- Use clear, descriptive monitor names
- Include relevant context in incident summaries
- Set up proper escalation procedures

## Security Considerations

- Webhook URLs contain sensitive information
- Store webhook URLs securely
- Regularly rotate webhook URLs
- Use private channels for sensitive data
- Monitor webhook usage and access
