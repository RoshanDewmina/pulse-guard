# Tokiflow - Comprehensive Feature Description

## Executive Summary

**Tokiflow** (formerly PulseGuard) is an advanced cron and scheduled job monitoring platform that combines real-time health monitoring with intelligent anomaly detection and multi-channel alerting. Unlike traditional "ping-only" monitoring services, Tokiflow provides deep runtime analytics, statistical anomaly detection, and rich integrations designed for modern DevOps workflows.

**Primary Use Case**: Monitor scheduled jobs, cron tasks, background workers, and periodic processes to ensure they run on time, complete successfully, and perform within expected parameters.

---

## Core Value Proposition

### What Problems Does Tokiflow Solve?

1. **Silent Job Failures**: Cron jobs and scheduled tasks that fail silently without notification
2. **Performance Degradation**: Jobs that are slowing down over time without triggering binary fail/success alerts
3. **Alert Fatigue**: Too many false positives from simplistic monitoring systems
4. **Delayed Detection**: Finding out hours or days later that critical backups or data pipelines failed
5. **Fragmented Tooling**: Needing multiple tools for monitoring, alerting, output capture, and analytics
6. **Missing Context**: Alerts that don't provide enough information to diagnose issues quickly

---

### 2. Ping API (Job Reporting)

#### Three-State Lifecycle Model
Unlike competitors that only support binary up/down, Tokiflow supports:

1. **START**: Job begins execution
   - Establishes baseline for duration tracking
   - Used for detecting "hung" jobs that never finish
   
2. **SUCCESS**: Job completes successfully
   - Includes duration, exit code, optional output
   - Resets incident state if previously failing
   
3. **FAIL**: Job fails
   - Includes error output, exit code
   - Creates incident with full context

#### Ping API Capabilities

**Basic Heartbeat**:
```bash
curl https://api.tokiflow.co/api/ping/YOUR_TOKEN
```

**With State & Metadata**:
```bash
# Start notification
curl "https://api.tokiflow.co/api/ping/YOUR_TOKEN?state=start"

# Success with duration
curl "https://api.tokiflow.co/api/ping/YOUR_TOKEN?state=success&durationMs=1234&exitCode=0"

# Failure with output
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  --data-binary @error.log \
  "https://api.tokiflow.co/api/ping/YOUR_TOKEN?state=fail&exitCode=1"
```

**API Features**:
- Token-based authentication (no complex auth flow needed)
- Sub-200ms response times (optimized for minimal job overhead)
- Idempotent operations
- Automatic deduplication
- Rate limiting protection (100+ req/sec supported)
- Geographic distribution for low latency

**Output Capture**:
- Accept up to 32KB of stdout/stderr
- Store in S3/MinIO with encryption
- Presigned URL access for secure viewing
- Automatic cleanup (configurable retention)
- Optional redaction for PII/secrets

---

### 3. Incident Detection & Management

#### Incident Types

Tokiflow detects **5 distinct incident types**:

1. **MISSED**: Job didn't run when scheduled
   - Detected by worker evaluating `nextDueAt` timestamps
   - Grace period applied before alerting

2. **LATE**: Job started but took too long to finish
   - Based on expected duration + tolerance
   - Useful for catching hung processes

3. **FAIL**: Job reported explicit failure
   - Exit code != 0 or explicit fail ping
   - Includes error output for troubleshooting

4. **ANOMALY**: Runtime deviates from statistical norm
   - Z-score > 3Ïƒ (configurable threshold)
   - Uses Welford's online algorithm for incremental stats
   - Detects both "too fast" (potential data skip) and "too slow" (degradation)

5. **DEGRADED**: Consistent pattern of slower performance
   - Multiple consecutive runs above p95
   - Early warning before critical failure

#### Incident Management Features

**Incident Lifecycle**:
- **OPEN**: New incident created
- **ACKNOWLEDGED**: Team aware, investigating
- **RESOLVED**: Issue fixed, monitor healthy
- **MUTED**: Temporarily suppressed (maintenance windows)

**Incident Deduplication**:
- Hash-based deduplication to prevent duplicate alerts
- Configurable dedup window
- Automatic incident grouping

**Rich Incident Data**:
- Timestamp of detection
- Full context (duration, exit code, output)
- Historical comparison (vs. p50, p95, p99)
- Related incidents (if part of cascade failure)
- Resolution notes and audit trail

**Interactive Actions**:
- Acknowledge incidents (via UI or Slack button)
- Mute for X hours/days
- Resolve with notes
- Snooze alerts temporarily
- Escalate to on-call (future: PagerDuty integration)

### 5. Analytics & Insights

#### Dashboard Overview

**High-Level Metrics** (Organization-wide):
- Total monitors active
- Incidents last 7/30/90 days
- Overall health score (weighted average)
- Uptime percentage
- Alerting volume trends

**Per-Monitor Analytics**:

**1. Health Score (0-100)**
- Algorithm:
  ```
  Health = (Uptime * 0.4) + (SuccessRate * 0.3) + (PerformanceScore * 0.3)
  ```
- Factors:
  - Uptime: Percentage of expected runs that occurred
  - Success Rate: Percentage of runs without incidents
  - Performance: Inverse of anomaly frequency
- Color-coded: 90-100 (green), 70-89 (yellow), <70 (red)

**2. Uptime Tracking**
- Calculate uptime as: `(total_runs - missed_runs) / total_runs`
- Historical uptime graphs (7d, 30d, 90d, 1y)
- SLA reporting (e.g., "99.5% uptime last quarter")

**3. Reliability Metrics**
- **MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)**:
  - Average time between incidents
  - Higher = more reliable
- **MTTR (Mean Time To Resolution)**:
  - Average time from incident open â†’ resolved
  - Lower = faster response
- **Failure Rate**:
  - Percentage of runs that result in incidents
  - Trending over time

**4. Performance Analytics**
- **Duration Statistics**:
  - p50 (median), p95, p99 percentiles
  - Min/max/mean/stddev
  - Historical trending
- **Anomaly Detection**:
  - Welford's online algorithm for incremental variance
  - Z-score calculation: `z = (duration - mean) / stddev`
  - Alert when `|z| > 3` (3-sigma rule)
  - Visual indicators when job runs faster/slower than norm
- **Distribution Histogram**:
  - Visual representation of duration distribution
  - Identify bimodal patterns (e.g., fast-path vs. slow-path)

**5. Output Analysis** (Future AI Feature)
- Keyword extraction from error logs
- Common failure pattern detection
- Root cause suggestion using LLM

#### Visualizations

**Charts & Graphs**:
- Uptime calendar heatmap (GitHub-style)
- Duration over time (line chart)
- Incident distribution (bar chart by type)
- Success/failure ratio (pie chart)
- Response time trends (area chart)

**Export Options**:
- CSV export for all metrics
- PDF reports for monthly summaries
- API access for custom dashboards (Grafana, etc.)

---

### 6. Anomaly Detection Engine

#### Technical Implementation

**Welford's Algorithm** (Online Variance Calculation):
- Incremental statistics without storing all data points
- Numerically stable (avoids floating-point errors)
- Memory efficient (O(1) space)

**Algorithm**:
```python
# For each new duration value:
n += 1
delta = duration - mean
mean += delta / n
M2 += delta * (duration - mean)
variance = M2 / n
stddev = sqrt(variance)
z_score = (duration - mean) / stddev
```

**Z-Score Interpretation**:
- `|z| < 1`: Within 1 standard deviation (68% of data) - Normal
- `|z| < 2`: Within 2 standard deviations (95% of data) - Acceptable
- `|z| > 3`: Beyond 3 standard deviations (99.7% of data) - **ANOMALY**

**Positive vs. Negative Anomalies**:
- **Positive Z-score**: Job took longer than expected (degradation)
- **Negative Z-score**: Job completed faster than expected (potential data skip or error)

**Minimum Sample Size**:
- Require at least 10 runs before anomaly detection activates
- Prevents false positives during initial "learning" phase

**Anomaly Alert Details**:
- Current duration vs. expected (mean)
- Z-score value
- Historical context (p50/p95/p99)
- Suggested actions based on anomaly type

#### Use Cases for Anomaly Detection

1. **Database Backup Monitoring**:
   - Alert if backup takes 3x longer than usual (data growth issue)
   - Alert if backup completes in 10% of normal time (backup didn't actually run)

2. **Data Pipeline Performance**:
   - Detect when ETL jobs slow down due to increasing data volume
   - Identify when jobs skip processing (complete too fast)

3. **API Health Checks**:
   - Spot gradual degradation in response times
   - Catch when health check script errors out instantly

4. **Report Generation**:
   - Alert when report generation takes abnormally long
   - Detect processing errors (report generated with no data)
