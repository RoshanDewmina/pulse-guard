## 📝 What You Need From Me To Publish

I've created a comprehensive checklist in `REQUIREMENTS_FROM_USER.md`. Here's the summary:

### 🚨 CRITICAL (Cannot Launch Without)

1. **Domain Name** - What domain do you want? (e.g., `tokiflow.co`)
2. **Hosting Platform** - Choose: Vercel (easiest), Railway, or VPS
3. **Database** - Choose: Supabase (free tier), Neon, or Railway
4. **Email Service** - Choose: Resend (free 100/day) or SendGrid
5. **NextAuth Secret** - Run: `openssl rand -base64 32`
6. **S3 Storage** - Choose: Cloudflare R2 (free 10GB), AWS S3, or DO Spaces

### ⚠️ HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

7. **Google OAuth** - For social login
8. **Stripe** - For paid subscriptions (or skip for free tier only)
9. **Redis** - For background jobs (or use in-memory)

### 🎯 OPTIONAL (Can Add Later)

10. **Slack Integration** - Better alerts
11. **Sentry** - Error tracking

### 💰 Minimum Cost to Launch

Using ALL free tiers: **$0-10/month** (only domain cost)

With scale (1000+ users): **$50-200/month**
